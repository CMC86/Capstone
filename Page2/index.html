      <h2>DOOM VS. FACTS</h2>
      <p>A few years back, Bobbitio Garcia had to set the records straight regarding MF DOOM’s first release under the moniker. Many people believed that Operation: Doomsday released April 20, 1999, but according to the invoice above, the earliest date possible would have to be at least August 10 or later. The common consensus nowadays is that the official release was October 19, 1999.</p>

      <h2>NAPSTER: FOR BETTER OR WORSE</h2>
      <p>Napster created quite a ruckus when it was first introduced in 1999. Many were concerned that it would have negative effects on a artists’ ability to make money from their music, primarily because there wasn’t a clear agreement between the platform and artist/record label regarding how payment would be distributed once a consumer purchased music on the Napster platform. A few years later, iTunes was introduced to the world. As things continued to evolve, music eventually shifted to digital mp3 as a primary format for consumption. Nowadays, streaming platforms like Sportify and Apple Music have given all artists, professional or amateur, an opportunity release their music to the entire world.</p>

      <h2>BIRTH OF AN ICON: SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS</h2>
      <p>If you could take a time machine back to the summer of 1999, and ask any person familiar with a new cartoon called “SpongeBob SquarePants”, most of them would probably say it was another one of those shows that would just come and go, like many others at the time. Fast forward to nearly 30 years later, and it’s become one of the biggest entities in pop culture.</p>
